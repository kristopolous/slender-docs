# Connecting the API to the CMS

## Preparation

This tutorial presumes that you have the [API](api.html) and the [CMS](cms.html) set up in their own respective virtual machines. If you don't, you should do that before proceeding.

Since the API and the CMS run on separate virtual machines you must configure them to talk to each other.
