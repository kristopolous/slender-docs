# Approach

We can approach this problem in a very traditional way:

1. Define our model
1. Define our endpoints
1. Write some tests
1. Make the tests pass
1. Create a functional interface that wires the endpoints

## Define our model

In order to define our model we need to edit the file `./app/config/resources.php`

## Define our endpoints

## Write some tests

## Make the tests pass

Create a functional interface that wires the endpoints
